# You deserve to have These (你理应拥有这些)

A fabric-based Minecraft modpack dedicated to allowing you to enjoy the features that should have belonged to Minecraft.  
一个基于Farbic的Minecraft模组整合包，致力于让你享受到本该属于Minecraft的功能。  

Microsoft Mojang know shit about Minecraft, any one person knows more about Minecraft than it.  
微软Mojang懂个屁的Minecraft，任何一个人都比它更懂Minecraft。

## Differences and Features (差异和特色)

[**Mod list(模组列表)**](INCLUDED-MODS.md)  
Fully client-side! (You can use it on almost all of the original servers!)  
完全客户端! (你可以在几乎所有的原版服务器上使用它！)  
[Warning: Because the modpack contains client-side components that modify game mechanics, using this modpack on most PVP servers and servers with stricter anti-cheat will result in you being banned. But that means it's perfectly viable to use it on servers with lax anti-cheating! (Mods that will be judged primarily as cheats are already marked in the mods list, so you can check exactly what they do and remove them at any time if you want)]  
[警告：因为整合包包含修改游戏机制的客户端组件，因此在大多数PVP服务器和具有较严格反作弊的服务器上使用这个整合包会导致你被封禁。但这意味着在宽松反作弊的服务器上使用它是完全可行的！（主要会被判断为作弊的模组已经在模组列表标注，如果你想，你可以查看它们具体做了什么，并随时移除它们）]  

There is a kind of "precious", called "only when you lose you know precious".  
有一种 "珍贵"，叫做 "失去才知道珍贵"。  
You never question and care about all the precious things you have, until you lose it and you realize it is so unique.  
你从来不会质疑和在意你所拥有的一切珍贵事物，直到你失去它，你才意识到它是那么的独一无二。  
And here, this modpack is the "unique and precious".
而在这，这个整合包就是那份“独一无二的珍贵。”

Too often, our modpack is stuffed with mods that don't make sense, the modpack looks bloated, and those unnecessary mods look redundant.  
很多时候，我们的整合包里塞满了意义不明的模组，整合包看起来很臃肿，那些不必要的模组看起来很多余。  
But they are like the dust that exists in life, seemingly meaningless, but actually the key to rainwater formation - condensation nuclei.  
但它们就像是生活中存在的灰尘，看起来没意义，但实际上却是雨水形成的关键——凝结核。  
We miraculously merged all these seemingly dispensable things inside this modpack and made them coexist in harmony.  
我们奇迹般的将这些看似可以舍去的事物全部合并在这个整合包里面，让它们和谐共处。  

We made a lot of changes, such as disabling the rendering of the original shadows for you by default, because that looks really ugly; For example, the basic configuration of many mods has been modified for you to make them more comfortable to use, and the I'm not the first time I've seen the "Inventory Profiles Next" configuration button stay on every player's backpack page; For example, the default volume of Minecraft is adjusted for you, the weather sound is lowered and the music volume is turned off (I think most users will turn it off, at least everyone around me does).  
我们做了很多的改动，例如为你默认禁止原版阴影的渲染，因为那看起来真的很丑；例如为你修改了很多模组的基础配置，让它们使用起来更加舒适，我不是第一次看到“一键背包整理”的配置按钮停留在每一个玩家的背包页面；例如为你将Minecraft的默认音量进行调整，将天气的声音降低，将音乐的音量关闭（我认为大多数用户都会关闭它，至少我身边的人都是这么做的）。  

There are many, many changes, many, many additions, why I call this modpack "You-deserve-to-have-These", because these changes are in line with our intuitive changes, you will not feel anything wrong with these changes.  
还有很多很多的改动，很多很多的添加，为什么我要称呼这个整合包为“你理应拥有这些”，因为这些改动都是顺应我们直觉的改变，你并不会觉得这些变动有什么不妥。  
It's hard to even feel the slight changes made by this modpack, until one day you stop using this modpack and use a modpack made by someone else, and suddenly you realize - "all those features that seem to you to be there as they should be are from this modpack".  
你甚至很难感受到这个整合包做出的一些细微改动，直到有一天你不再使用这个整合包，而用其他人制作的整合包的时候，你会突然发现————“那些在你看来都是理所应当存在的功能都是源自这个整合包”。

## Accessibility

Fabulously Optimized is designed to be accessible for everyone, and as such contains the following accessibility features on its latest version.

* The first-run accessibility screen introduced in 1.19.4 is _not_ used, to make the initial run experience smoother and faster. Instead, users can continue to take advantage of the extended keyboard support included in said version.
  * Languages screen can be accessed by pressing "right arrow" and "enter"
  * Accessibility screen can be accessed by pressing "left arrow", "left arrow" and "enter"
* Users can search for and select multiple languages
  * Selecting multiple languages is useful for users who know several, and for languages with variants (like Spanish), to ensure mods are translated as much as possible
  * Items have the original names on their tooltips for command usage purposes
* Game controllers are supported
* [Several launchers are supported](#downloads)
* [The purpose and settings for each included mod are displayed in the mod menu](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/changed-options#resource-packs)
* Splash screen is black, similar to Bedrock Edition
* Other [changed options](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/changed-options) to match users' expectations

## Disclaimers

By using this modpack, you agree to the following:

* The modpack has been set up to be compatible with the rules of most public third-party servers, but it is your responsibility to verify whether you are allowed to use it or not. By installing this modpack you agree that the modpack author, the mod developers and Mojang provide no warranties for using this modpack, every action you do with it is your own.   
    * The command *`/ghost`* (provided by [AntiGhost](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/antighost)) may be disallowed by the rules on some servers [as it sends a slight amount of packets](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/antighost?comment=103), but it is safe if you don't spam it, use only when you are stuck in blocks.
* This modpack is using [Starlight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/starlight) for chunk optimization and [due to the way it works](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md#chunk-save-format), disabling (or replacing) the mod will make your existing worlds initially load a bit slower. This is harmless, it simply means the game is calculating the lit up areas again with a different algorithm.
* This modpack disables the [third-party server disclaimer](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Multiplayer_disclaimer.png), so if you are using the multiplayer function, you also agree to the following: 
    > Caution: Online play is offered by third-party servers that are not owned, operated, or supervised by Mojang Studios or Microsoft. During online play, you may be exposed to unmoderated chat messages or other types of user-generated content that may not be suitable for everyone. 
    *  [The "social interactions" screen](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Social_Interactions_screen#Usage) can be used by pressing the key `P` in-game or the `Player Reporting` button in the pause menu.
    * On servers where Mojang's chat reporting is optional, the modpack opts out of it for the playing user - adhering to server's intent. Chat status icons are changed to provide more accurate information about the signing state of the server. [Read more](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/chat-reporting-faq).
* Fabulously Optimized does not host any capes or other cosmetics, nor does it encourage users to buy them from any provider. Instead, the modpack encourages users to [prefer free cosmetics](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/free-cape), while also giving them options to use any paid cosmetics they've previously obtained from certain providers.  
* Yes, you can fork/remix this pack [according to the license](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/LICENSE.md). You cannot, however, use the "Fabulously Optimized" name or logo to _represent_ your fork (but you can mention that you forked it).
