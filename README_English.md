# You deserve to have These

A fabric-based Minecraft modpack dedicated to allowing you to enjoy the features that should have belonged to Minecraft.  

Microsoft Mojang know shit about Minecraft, any one person knows more about Minecraft than it.  

## Differences and Features

[**ðŸ“œMod list**](INCLUDED-MODS.md)  
Fully client-side! (You can use it on almost all of the original servers!)  
[Warning: Because the modpack contains client-side components that modify game mechanics, using this modpack on most PVP servers and servers with stricter anti-cheat will result in you being banned. But that means it's perfectly viable to use it on servers with lax anti-cheating! (Mods that will be judged primarily as cheats are already marked in the mods list, so you can check exactly what they do and remove them at any time if you want)]  

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”  
There is a kind of "precious", called "only when you lose you know precious".  

You never question and care about all the precious things you have, until you lose it and you realize it is so unique.  

And here, this modpack is the "unique and precious".  

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”  
Too often, our modpack is stuffed with mods that don't make sense, the modpack looks bloated, and those unnecessary mods look redundant.  

They are like the dust that exists in life, seemingly meaningless, but actually the key to rainwater formation - condensation nuclei.  

We miraculously merged all these seemingly dispensable things into this modpack, making them coexist harmoniously and eventually producing qualitative change from quantitative change.  

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”  
We made a lot of changes, such as disabling the rendering of the original shadows for you by default, because that looks really ugly; For example, the basic configuration of many mods has been modified for you to make them more comfortable to use, and the I'm not the first time I've seen the "Inventory Profiles Next" configuration button stay on every player's backpack page; For example, the default volume of Minecraft is adjusted for you, the weather sound is lowered and the music volume is turned off (I think most users will turn it off, at least everyone around me does).  

There are many, many changes, many, many additions, why I call this modpack "You-deserve-to-have-These", because these changes are in line with our intuitive changes, you will not feel anything wrong with these changes.  

It's hard to even feel the slight changes made by this modpack, until one day you stop using this modpack and use a modpack made by someone else, and suddenly you realize - "all those features that seem to you to be there as they should be are from this modpack".  


## Good after-sales experience (although we don't sell anything)

The makers of the You-deserve-to-have-These modpack worked tirelessly to improve the modpack until the current version was stable and there was nowhere else to improve.  
Unlike other modpack makers who just put mods together, You-deserve-to-have-These modpack makers will modify the configuration of each mod based on the user's experience, find out the bugs in those mods, and actively contact the mod authors to fix them.  
You can give feedback to the You-deserve-to-have-These modpack maker on this github about the problems you encountered in the game, and entrust him to fix them for you by asking him to help you contact the mod authors to fix them.  

There are too many contact records for me to show here, but the contributions made by user "Surfish" in the Minecraft community are real.
