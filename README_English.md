# You deserve to have These<br>你理应拥有这些

A fabric-based Minecraft modpack dedicated to allowing you to enjoy the features that should have belonged to Minecraft.  
一个基于Farbic的Minecraft模组整合包，致力于让你享受到本该属于Minecraft的功能。  

Microsoft Mojang know shit about Minecraft, any one person knows more about Minecraft than it.  
微软Mojang懂个屁的Minecraft，任何一个人都比它更懂Minecraft。

## Differences and Features<br>差异和特色

[**📜Mod list(模组列表)**](INCLUDED-MODS.md)  
Fully client-side! (You can use it on almost all of the original servers!)  
完全客户端! (你可以在几乎所有的原版服务器上使用它！)  
[Warning: Because the modpack contains client-side components that modify game mechanics, using this modpack on most PVP servers and servers with stricter anti-cheat will result in you being banned. But that means it's perfectly viable to use it on servers with lax anti-cheating! (Mods that will be judged primarily as cheats are already marked in the mods list, so you can check exactly what they do and remove them at any time if you want)]  
[警告：因为整合包包含修改游戏机制的客户端组件，因此在大多数PVP服务器和具有较严格反作弊的服务器上使用这个整合包会导致你被封禁。但这意味着在宽松反作弊的服务器上使用它是完全可行的！（主要会被判断为作弊的模组已经在模组列表标注，如果你想，你可以查看它们具体做了什么，并随时移除它们）]

There is a kind of "precious", called "only when you lose you know precious".  
有一种 "珍贵"，叫做 "失去才知道珍贵"。  
You never question and care about all the precious things you have, until you lose it and you realize it is so unique.  
你从来不会质疑和在意你所拥有的一切珍贵事物，直到你失去它，你才意识到它是那么的独一无二。  
And here, this modpack is the "unique and precious".  
而在这，这个整合包就是那份“独一无二的珍贵。”  
————————  
Too often, our modpack is stuffed with mods that don't make sense, the modpack looks bloated, and those unnecessary mods look redundant.  
很多时候，我们的整合包里塞满了意义不明的模组，整合包看起来很臃肿，那些不必要的模组看起来很多余。  
They are like the dust that exists in life, seemingly meaningless, but actually the key to rainwater formation - condensation nuclei.  
它们就像是生活中存在的灰尘，看起来没意义，但实际上却是雨水形成的关键——凝结核。  
We miraculously merged all these seemingly dispensable things into this modpack, making them coexist harmoniously and eventually producing qualitative change from quantitative change.  
我们奇迹般的将这些看似可以舍去的事物全部合并在这个整合包里面，使得它们和谐共处，并最终从量变产生质变。  
————————  
We made a lot of changes, such as disabling the rendering of the original shadows for you by default, because that looks really ugly; For example, the basic configuration of many mods has been modified for you to make them more comfortable to use, and the I'm not the first time I've seen the "Inventory Profiles Next" configuration button stay on every player's backpack page; For example, the default volume of Minecraft is adjusted for you, the weather sound is lowered and the music volume is turned off (I think most users will turn it off, at least everyone around me does).  
我们做了很多的改动，例如为你默认禁止原版阴影的渲染，因为那看起来真的很丑；例如为你修改了很多模组的基础配置，让它们使用起来更加舒适，我不是第一次看到“一键背包整理”的配置按钮停留在每一个玩家的背包页面；例如为你将Minecraft的默认音量进行调整，将天气的声音降低，将音乐的音量关闭（我认为大多数用户都会关闭它，至少我身边的人都是这么做的）。  
There are many, many changes, many, many additions, why I call this modpack "You-deserve-to-have-These", because these changes are in line with our intuitive changes, you will not feel anything wrong with these changes.  
还有很多很多的改动，很多很多的添加，为什么我要称呼这个整合包为“你理应拥有这些”，因为这些改动都是顺应我们直觉的改变，你并不会觉得这些变动有什么不妥。  
It's hard to even feel the slight changes made by this modpack, until one day you stop using this modpack and use a modpack made by someone else, and suddenly you realize - "all those features that seem to you to be there as they should be are from this modpack".  
你甚至很难感受到这个整合包做出的一些细微改动，直到有一天你不再使用这个整合包，而用其他人制作的整合包的时候，你会突然发现————“那些在你看来都是理所应当存在的功能都是源自这个整合包”。

## Good after-sales experience (although we don't sell anything)<br>良好的售后体验（虽然我们不销售任何东西）

The makers of the You-deserve-to-have-These modpack worked tirelessly to improve the modpack until the current version was stable and there was nowhere else to improve.  
Unlike other modpack makers who just put mods together, You-deserve-to-have-These modpack makers will modify the configuration of each mod based on the user's experience, find out the bugs in those mods, and actively contact the mod authors to fix them.  
You can give feedback to the You-deserve-to-have-These modpack maker on this github about the problems you encountered in the game, and entrust him to fix them for you by asking him to help you contact the mod authors to fix them.  
You-deserve-to-have-These的整合包制作者不知疲倦的改善这个整合包，直到当前版本趋于稳定，无处可以改进的时候。  
不同于其它整合包制作者只是将模组们拼凑在一起，You-deserve-to-have-These的整合包制作者会根据用户的使用体验去修改每个模组的配置，并找出那些模组中存在的错误，积极的联系模组作者修复它们。  
你可以在这个github反馈给You-deserve-to-have-These的整合包制作者你在游戏中遇到的问题，并委托他为你进行修复，委托他帮助你联系模组的作者去修复。  
There are too many contact records for me to show here, but the contributions made by user "Surfish" in the Minecraft community are real.  
有太多的联系记录我没法在这里展示，但用户“Surfish”在Minecraft社区所做的贡献是真实存在的。
